GameJam "The Future"

idea:
flexibly changing dimensions, making time a space dim and vice versa
-> does it even make sense?

initial appeal:
walked distance becomes floor
kind of drawing in 3D space (if it is 2D physics, e.g. Jump'n'Run)
maybe also "3D music" (MIDI notes)

time:
flowing in one direction with event listener each frame

thought exp.:
normal J'n'R: time axis open/n.d. if not time is not passed
	if it was already existing --> no freedom
it follows: time dimension needs to be overwritten by agent
	there should then be no logical conflicts, if only one agent

gameplay:
step on one's "time movements"
all axes have unique effects (gravity|locomotion|time) -> 6 orders
instead of enemies: --> other players; they can camouflage
multiplayer?! overwriting other world? -> see a "great filter" in space fim approaching -> find a dim switch item before

goal:
multiplayer: survive last (benefit: no levels)

story:
maybe time travelers become great filters
beginning question: "Does the future exist?" --> yes, but can be overwritten

TODO:
lots of gameplay tweaking (how many players, items, what starting terrain, what distribution? how big is level?)
Implementation (JS in Browser? Mobile?)
Music composition
